This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Please note:

- The suggested video can't be used because the display has been blocked by the owner:
<div align='center'>
  <img src='./screenshots/error.png'  />
</div>

- On mobile and tablet the video list implements a vertical scroll, on desktop the scroll is horizontal. In both cases the list implements a CSS scroll snapping.

- Basic tests have been implemented
